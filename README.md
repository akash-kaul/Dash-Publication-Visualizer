# Dash-Publication-Visualizer
### *Dynamic Author Search of Covid-19 Articles using Plotly and Dash and TigerGraph*
This code walks you through how to make your own interactive dashboard to analyze covid-19 articles using Dash from Plotly and TigerGraph

## Motivation
Dash is a powerful developer tool from Plotly that allows you to create fully interactive web applications using just Python! I decided to explore a small fraction of what is possible with Dash. In my exploration, I created an author lookup for a [collection of Covid -19 articles](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge). The data storage and manipulation is powered by TigerGraph Cloud.

## Framework
Python built with [Atom.](https://atom.io/)

GSQL queries built with [TigerGraph Cloud.](https://www.tigergraph.com/cloud/)
